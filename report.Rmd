This is my semester project for BIOS 611 in Fall 2023. My analysis focuses on crime data from the city of Chicago, Illinois between the years 2001 and 2023. I will focus on data from 2020. Variables observed include date of incident, type of crime, precinct, ward, address, crime description, and more. In addition to detailed data on 2020, I will briefly analyze time trends for the entire time-span, focusing on crime frequency, not specific to a certain type.
